easy erect im happy look leaves bit shiny got used thanks
quick easy way add greenery trellis expandable dimensions vary little expand optimal length although two meters long 30 centimetres wide doesnt give great deal coverage may want depending needs wanted use along back work desk separate person side perfect size first impressions leaves shiny whilst theyre fairly realistic detailed plastic sheen hopefully fade time im using mine indoors guess would weather little outside combination different shades leaf stem green trailers gives instant bit greenery splash colour biggest perhaps realistic lot instant colours bargain price good quality good value highly recommended
artificial leaf expanding trellis quite robust size fairly adjustable usual trellis stretch 2m bit shorter widerits ideal adding bit privacy need quite leaves fixed onto itthey obviously artificial personally find bright green plastic trellis little unappealing would prefer brown like faux woodhowever thats personal taste thing
although never going look anything artificial sturdy plastic trellis opens closes easily tell going durablei little disappointed quite small price made quite clear description thats piece fence ended 14 inches tall 4 6 wideobviously apart pull ie longer make bigger gaps trellis slats even furthest stretch quite lot coverageoverall im fairly pleased trellis durable waterproof wont rot need treating like wooden bamboo trellis take quite pieces cover significant area
live flat balcony garden green witch raging thirst time green plants treesso im trick brain feeling actually amongst woods trees actually get livethis panel looks good cover red brick balcony getting another one least makes feel calm look
like job lots green leaves overall looks nicei needed cover single space steps prevent neighbours dog trying catch cat going stairsthe dog young jumpy actually put face one space others accessible highi used zip ties mount neighbours extra greenery cats safe dog stopped getting crazyit stretches 2m 1m gives nice impression thick leaves

come sides covered annoyingly difficult remove sticker coating couple reviewers suggest using hair dryer heck im going sit half hour hair dryer razor scraper shouldnt even start couldnt bothered deal went trash got something different
acrylic sheets looking theyre inexpensive compared photography displays backgrounds ive seen onlinei agree removing protective paper complete pain much took paper one side could definitely benefit adding tab overhang help assist removal process
protective film pain get bad heat took 5 minutes get boards heat really like reflection black board gives items used white board seems worthless seems pretty sturdy issue scratches watch dust dog fur boards seem magnet stuff
great value exactly looking reflective came without scratches thanks brown coveringdont worry brown covering hard get took 10 minutes tops get panels fingernails heat doesnt leave residue like sticker comes clean comes big chunks
exactly expected another helpful reviewer mentioned hairdryer worked like charm dont pass reviews reason gave 4 stars shipped pieces styrofoam taped together open nothing store even ziplock style bag would helpful protect keep clean otherwise exactly looking
good quality value money daughter happy
